# Continuous Integration for a Python Package: Streamlining Development Workflow

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CICD) has become a cornerstone in modern software development, providing a structured approach to building and deploying applications seamlessly. While traditionally associated with web applications, the principles of CI are equally applicable to various codebases, including Python packages. This article delves into the implementation of Continuous Integration for Python packages, emphasizing its significance, steps involved, and the practicalities of its execution.

## Understanding Continuous Integration for Python Packages

Continuous Integration (CI) offers several advantages, even for projects that don't involve constant building and testing. For Python packages, CI provides confidence in code changes, resolves conflicts during integration, and ensures the code works across different environments. By accelerating development cycles, CI fosters stable software development without conflicts, making it an invaluable practice.

## Starting a CI Pipeline

### Setting Up a CI Toolchain

The initial step involves choosing a CI toolchain. This article focuses on GitHub Actions due to its integration with GitHub repositories. A sample CI workflow is defined in a YAML file (`ci.yml`) within the `.github/workflows` directory.

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

This workflow triggers on every push to the main branch, installs dependencies, and runs tests using the specified Python version.

## Working with Continuous Integration

### Pushing Changes

Developers push changes to the version control system (VCS), triggering the CI workflow.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

### Monitoring Workflow

Developers monitor the CI workflow in the GitHub repository's "Actions" tab. It displays the progress, status, and logs of each step.

### Interpreting Results

In case of workflow failure, developers inspect the logs to identify issues, address them, commit changes, and push again.

## Building a Python Image for CI

To streamline CI, a dedicated Python image is created, encapsulating necessary tools. The following Dockerfile provides a starting point:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt update && apt install software-properties-common -y
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
RUN apt install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl sudo jq
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

RUN useradd -m compliance && echo "compliance:docker" | chpasswd && adduser compliance sudo
RUN mkdir -p /home/compliance
```

This image includes Python, Git, and other essential tools for Python package development.

## Eliminating Unnecessary Stages in CI

### Stages to be Eliminated

DevSecOps CI pipelines often include stages not applicable to Python packages. Two approaches are suggested:

1. Use empty, fake stages containing simple echoes.
2. Modify Tekton instructions to eliminate or redesign unnecessary stages.

For example, a fake containerize stage:

```yaml
containerize:
  dind: true
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo 'hello containerize'
```

The second approach involves modifying Tekton instructions, which may be more efficient but requires periodic updates.

## Integrating Artifactory

JFrog Artifactory can be integrated into CI pipelines for PyPI package distribution. Credentials are retrieved from Artifactory and used in the pip configuration.

```bash
export artifactory_secret="$(cat /config/secure-properties/artifactory_dockerconfigjson)"
export ARTIFACTORY_USER=$(echo $artifactory_secret | base64 -d | jq . | grep username | cut -d '"' -f 4)
export ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY=$(echo $artifactory_secret | base64 -d | jq . | grep password | cut -d '"' -f 4)

pip config set global.index-url https://${ARTIFACTORY_USER}:${ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY}@na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/pypi/wdp-cloumpose-pypi-virtual/simple
```

## Revisiting Stages

### Unit Test

Unit tests in Python can be executed using tools like nose. Ensure unit tests are quick and include mocking functions to prevent real network requests.

```yaml
test:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  abort_on_failure: true
  script: |
    echo "=== unit test ==="
    pip3 install nose
    cd /workspace/app/$app_name
    pip3 install -q -r requirements.txt.  
    nosetests -v test
```

### Version Check

Ensure version changes are tracked and reported. Include a script to check version updates in the unit test stage.

```yaml
test:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  abort_on_failure: true
  script: |
    PR=$(echo $TRIGGER_PAYLOAD | jq .number)
    if [ $PR == 'null' ]; then
      PR=false
    else
      echo "===  version_check ==="
      echo "PR is $PR"
      cd /workspace/app/$app_name
      sh -x version_check.sh
```

### Static Scan

Integrate Flake8 for code style checks and Bandit for security scans into the CI pipeline.

```yaml
static-scan:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  abort_on_failure: true
  script: |
    echo '===static scan==='
    cd /workspace/app/$app_name

    pip3 install -r devrequirements.txt
    pip3 list
    flake8 *
    bandit -r *
``

`

### Detect Secrets

Use a tool like detect-secrets to scan for sensitive information in the source code.

```yaml
detect-secrets:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  abort_on_failure: true
  script: |
    echo '===detect-secrets==='
    cd /workspace/app/$app_name
    detect-secrets scan --exclude-files .secrets.baseline
```

### Development Release and Final Release

Implement stages for development release, final release, and promotion to move the package between repositories.

```yaml
development-release:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  script: |
    echo '===development release==='
    # Add code to move the package to the development repository

final-release:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  script: |
    echo '===final release==='
    # Add code to move the package to the final repository
```

### Acceptance Test

Conduct acceptance tests to verify the package's readiness for end users.

```yaml
acceptance-test:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/baseimage:2.55.4_commons-0.8.6@sha256:4b5aa2cc07d59b8b19d214cbd053e0fbb777b37fd722a06bd8817cbe4daeedf3
  script: |
    echo '===acceptance test==='
    # Add code to install the package from the development repository and conduct acceptance tests
```

## Conclusion

Setting up a CI pipeline for a Python package involves careful consideration of stages, tools, and integrations. While Python packages may not be deployed as web services, ensuring high-quality code through comprehensive testing, version tracking, and security scans is vital. A well-designed CI pipeline enhances collaboration, maintains code quality, and contributes to the overall success of a software project.
